DOM - Document Object Model
- Structured representation of html documents. allows javascript to access html elements and styles to manipulate them.
- Change text, HTML attributes, CSS styles
- DOM is automatically created by the browser as soon as the HTML page loads and it stores in a tree structure
- Document is a special object that is the entry point to the DOM
- DOM is not Javascript 
- DOM and DOM methods are part of WEB APIs
- DOM manipulation works the same on all browsers

Event Listener
- An event is something that happens on the page. ex: mouse click, mouse moving, key press
 
Obtaining the score value can be done using DOM also but it is better to initialize a value inside the JS, then this becomes a state variable. All the data should be available inside the JS code.

Code is refactored using ternary operator, functions and combining <, > into a !==
